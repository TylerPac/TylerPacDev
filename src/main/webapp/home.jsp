    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my developer portfolio!</h2>
    <p>
        I'm <strong>Tyler</strong>, currently completing my <strong>Bachelor of Applied Science in Computing Technology & Software Development</strong>.
        I love solving problems through code and building things that make life easier (or cooler).
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been developing for <strong>DayZ (Enfusion Engine)</strong> for over 3 years, working in both <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>
        to create custom mods, systems, and gameplay mechanics for multiplayer servers. That hands-on experience has taught me everything from client-server logic to performance optimization in game environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        My primary focus is in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, but I also enjoy exploring <strong>Unreal Engine with C++</strong>,
        tinkering in <strong>Python</strong>, and getting creative with <strong>JavaScript</strong> and front-end work.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site showcases some of my favorite projects â€” it's a live demonstration of what Iâ€™ve built, what Iâ€™m learning, and what Iâ€™m capable of.
        Thanks for checking it out!
